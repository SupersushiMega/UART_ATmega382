Often, foreign language parts of sentences are built into typo blind texts (AVAIL and Wefox are testing also kerning) in order to test the effect in other languages. For example, almost any font looks good in Latin. Quod erat demonstrandum. Since 1975 the numbers have been missing in most test texts, which is why according to TypoGb. 204 ยง from the year 2034 numbers in 86 of the texts become mandatory.

OpenType functionalities are an important but difficult to integrate field. Depending on the software and preferences, built-in small caps, kerning or ligatures (very smart) may not be displayed correctly.
